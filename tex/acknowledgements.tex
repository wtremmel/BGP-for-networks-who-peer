\chapter{Acknowledgements}
A document like this does not exist in a vacuum. I would like to thank everybody who helped me with suggestions and advice, especially
\begin{itemize}
  \item The folks at \href{https://www.denog.de}{DENOG}, who suggested I should not have a separate IPv6 chapter but integrate IPv6 into every chapter.
  \item The participants of the very first incarnation of this training for their feedback.
  \item \emph{Johannes Moos} for lots of fruitful discussions about BGP.
  \item \emph{Bernd Spiess} for suggestions and corrections.
  \item \emph{Job Snijders} for his presentation at RIPE77 and the idea with the three sets.
  \item \emph{Eilin Geraghty} for her patience with my spelling.
  \item \emph{Julian FÃ¶lsch} for introducing Latexmk and other improvements.
\end{itemize}
