\chapter{A complete example}
In this chapter we will setup a BGP speaking router with all bells and whistles, using what we have learned in the previous chapters. All examples will be Cisco IOS, FRRouting (when different to Cisco) and Mikrotik. The configuration will be built bit by bit, the finalized configuration you can find in appendix \ref{ch:CompleteConfigs}).
